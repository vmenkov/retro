I was trying to use javax.json, with the JAR file coming  from
http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjavaxjson102jar.htm
or from 
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish/javax.json/1.1
However, that library was a lot slower than org.json (source code from Github),
so I reverted to the latter.
