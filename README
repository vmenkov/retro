I was trying to use javax.json, with the JAR file coming  from
http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjavaxjson102jar.htm
or from 
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish/javax.json/1.1
However, that library was a lot slower than org.json (source code from Github),
so I reverted to the latter.

cd lib
ln -s /usr/local/apache-openjpa-2.1.1/lib/commons-lang-2.4.jar  .

Apache Commons CSV library (package org.apache.commons.csv )

https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/
ln -s ../commons-csv-1.1/commons-csv-1.1.jar .
