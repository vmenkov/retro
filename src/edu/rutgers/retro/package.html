The Retroactive Coaccess-based Recommendation Machine

<p>
The code in this package implements a retroactive coaccess-based recommender. That is, it allows one to see how the coaccess matrix, and the recommendation lists based on it, have been changing throughout ArXiv.org's recorded history. On top of this, the application measures the effect of each user action on the coaccess matrix and, therefore, on the recommendation lists that the system would produce.

<P>There are two main components to this package: the data preparation application and the retroactive recommender application.
